VideoHeartbeatSample (AS)
=========================

1. Opening the project
To open the project, you may use either Flash Builder or IntelliJ. Choose the desired project from the projects/ folder.

2. Building and running
Each project embeds the required libraries and assets, so you should be able to build them in the desired IDE.

To run the sample, place the output files on a webserver and access the VideoHeartbeatSample.html page.
The output files are in projects/flashbuilder/bin-debug/ or in projects/intellij/out/, depending on the chosen IDE.

The sample comes with dummy values for all the configuration options (see Configuration.as). 
In order to see the demo working, you need to fill-in the configuration options with valid values, provided by Adobe.
