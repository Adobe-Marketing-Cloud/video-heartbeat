Included are notes from the latest major revision to current.

1.2.0 (17 Apr, 2014)
New features:
    - implemented VideoHeartbeat 1.2 API changes (VA-793)
    - eliminate the dependency on the AppMeasurement's Media module (VA-869)

Fixed issues:
    - the video length must be an integer value on SC calls (VA-849)
    - the total_duration parameter doesn't reset when replaying the same ad (VA-785)
    - unable to track post-roll ad-breaks because complete event is sent too soon (VA-593)

Known limitations:
    - during buffering periods no VideoHeartbeat calls are issued over the network (VA-724)

 - fixed issue where the values in the settings.xml are not parsed correctly if the XML file is indented (VA-749).

------------------------

1.1.0 (20 Feb, 2014)
 - major re-factoring: the data-collection core logic is no longer part of the AppMeasurement lib. It is now inside the VideoHeartbeat lib.
 - all the Heartbeat configuration params that were previously inside the ADBMobileConfig.json config file are now available to be set at run-time via the video-heartbeat configuration object.
 - a new destroy selector is now part of the ADBVideoHeartbeat public interface. Since the data-collection core logic is no longer implemented as a singleton tear-down operations are now possible. 
 - a new version static selector is now part of the ADBVideoHeartbeat public interface.
 - Works with version 4.0.2 of AppMeasurement iOS library.
