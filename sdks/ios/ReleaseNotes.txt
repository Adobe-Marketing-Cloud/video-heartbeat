 - major re-factoring: the data-collection core logic is no longer part of the AppMeasurement lib. It is now inside the VideoHeartbeat lib.
 - all the Heartbeat configuration params that were previously inside the ADBMobileConfig.json config file are now available to be set at run-time via the video-heartbeat configuration object.
