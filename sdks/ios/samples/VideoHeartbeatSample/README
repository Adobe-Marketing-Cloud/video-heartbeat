VideoHeartbeatSample (iOS)
=========================

1. Opening the project
To open the project, you use the XCode IDE. Load the project from the project/ folder.

2. Building and running
The project embeds the required libraries and assets, so you should be able to build in the IDE.

To run the sample, just press the play button inside XCode. The sample should work fine in the simulator.

The sample comes with dummy values for all the configuration options (see Configuration.m and the ADBMobileConfig.json configuration files). 
In order to actually see the demo working, you need to fill-in the configuration options with valid values, provided by Adobe.
